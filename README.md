The Interactive Map allows user to venture across the solar system and explore planatery bodies and solar features from the Sun to the Oort Cloud. Users can hover over these features for a brief description of the body, and can click on them for additional information.

Note that this page will only load the map on medium screen sizes or larger (1280px width), otherwise users will be prompted to return with a larger screen size in order to enjoy the map.

## Mars Special

Interested in all things Mars? Then the Mars Special is the page for you. It includes information about the Red Planet, including dynamic facts that change upon a user's return, and includes API calls for the Martian Weather Forecase, hundreds of images from Nasa based on four key search terms, and the ability to search for photos from several different cameras on the Curiousity Rover, where users can choose the camera and desired date of an image.

## Solar System Trivia

With three levels of increasingly difficult game choices, the Solar System Trivia games are sure to challenge even the most knowledgable of space-interested users. Each game mode has at least a dozen questions, and users will learn their final score upon answering the last question. Answers to several of the questions from each difficulty can be found on various pages of the application.
